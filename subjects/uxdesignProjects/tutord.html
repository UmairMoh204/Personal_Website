                        <p>During my competitive audit, we analyzed different educational platforms and how they structured their site. We didn't have access to our competitors admin's page and so we used pages that were accessible to us. One competitor that stuck out from the rest was Schoology. Schoology had shared many similarities with TutorD when it came to their targeted audience and their software's intended purpose. Throughout our competitive audit, we were kept in mind the similarities and difference between these sites. We put an emphasis on observing pages that had a lot of the same core purposes with TutorD and took inspiration from other educational platform that shared common themes but had ideas that can cross-implemented within the TutorD platform.</p>
                        <p>Some things that we took from our competitive audit was:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>How Schoology's emphasized the activities page where you're met with an activities page upon signing in. This was an observation that my team and I took into account when creating the TutorD prototype.</li>
                            <li>We noticed how Kahoot implemented an advanced reports area designed to track students' performance and progress.</li>
                            <li>How Quizlet's tracking, prioritizing, and mobilizing student progress page were displayed within Quizlet's page</li>
                        </ul>

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>I, alongside my team conducted a total of four Usability Tests to evaluate our basic prototype with key focus areas being implemented. For our Usability Testing, we didn't consistently do Usability Tests on one mid-fidelity prototype. We instead took a different approach and continued to make changes each time we did Usability Tests to cover all the pain-points within our prototype and ensure that the fixes we made were the correct kinds of fixes as we continued along throughout our Usability Test process. Throughout or Usability Testing process we:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We conducted Usability Tests</li>
                        <li>Synthesized our findings</li>
                        <li>Applied changes to prototype</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Some information We Gathered From The Usability Tests Were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>That participants wanted to see a progression status of individual students once viewing classrooms</li>
                        <li>The participants wanted to compare quarter/quarter, year/year, month/month statistics for the unit statistics</li>
                        <li>The participants wanted a Classroom page that shows student data for the current school year</li>
                    </ul>

            </div>

            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>Synthesizing</h2>
                <p>The way we synthesized our Usability Tests was by creating three categories.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Usability</li>
                    <li>Functionality</li>
                    <li>Changes</li>
                    <li>Action Items</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Usability was checking if the website was usable or not. Functionality checked to see if participants understood the purpose of drop downs and buttons and whether or not it brought them to their desired page. Changes was dedicated to areas that participants didn't like and wanted improved. From the information in changes, we added action items which were how we would implement those changes in order to solve participant problems with the interface.</p>

                    <p>For the high fidelity wireframes, we had a slow and steady progress with each Usability Test that we conducted. Our Mid-Fidelity became High Fidelity through the cyclical process of usability Tests, synthesizing, and applying changes. My responsibilities for this project consisted of:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating Classroom Page with full list of classrooms</li>

                    <p>There were some page that my team and I worked alongside one another to complete however there were some pages that we worked on individually during our own time. When creating the classroom page some information that I gathered from that were:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Applying a way where admin can see progress for each individual classroom without entering</li>
                        <li>Adding an onHover to the progress bar where you can see a percentile of growth within each individual classroom.</li>
                        <li>Filling the row of each classroom so that admin get as much information as possible with an reduced amount of whitespace.</li>
